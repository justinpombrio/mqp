# Algorithm
# ~~~~~~~~~
# (see CPSA Primer / Authentication Tests)
#
# 1. Find an unrealized reception node n.
#
# 2. Consider each simple ingredient c of n.
# Recv(n, t) & Ingredient(c, t) & Simple(c) -> Test(c, n);
#
# 3. Collect the topmost encryptions in which c appears from n's predecessors.
#
# 4. If c appears outside those encryptions in n, then the cut is unsolved.
#
# 5. A cut can be solved by:
#    a. Identifying a context of c with the topmost encryption of one of n's predecessors
#       (What other identifications are possible?)
#       (make (4) false)
#       (contraction)
#    b. Adding a listener node
#       (allow the advesary to break one of the encryptions)
#       (listener augmentation)
#    c. Adding a regular node
#       (regular augmentation)
