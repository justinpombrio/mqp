\section{Motivation}

  What are the advantages of geometric logic; why bother performing
  cryptographic protocol analysis in this new domain?

  Foremost, cryptographic protocol analysis is traditionally
  implemented in imperitive programming languages. Switching to a
  declarative style has the advantage of making correctness easier to
  verify, and the system easier to reason about in general. First
  order logic is also a natural way to express the definitions of the
  formalism used.

  Second, a geometric theory is both flexible and extensible. Any
  extension expressible in geometric logic can be added trivially; the
  only implementation concern is the priority of the rules.

  Third, the chase can perhaps shed some light on the working of
  existing algorithms. It seems to mimic them in a way; there is
  perhaps a close relation between the chase's search for minimal
  theories and the algorithms' search for representative shapes.

\section{Geometric Logic}

\subsection{Definitions}
  
  \begin{description}

  \item[Signature] A \emph{signature} consists of a set of
    \emph{relation symbols}, each with a natural numbered
    \emph{arity}.

  \item [Structure] A \emph{structure} over a signature has a
    non-empty set called a \emph{domain}, and assigns to each relation
    symbol in the signature a relation over this domain.

  \item[Homomorphism] A \emph{homomorphism} $h$ from one structure to
    another is a function from the domain of the first to the domain
    of the second that preserves relations.
    \[ R_A(a_1, ... a_n) &\imp& R_B(h(a_1), ... h(a_n)) \]

  \item[Atom] An \emph{atom} over a signature is a relation symbol
    applied to an appropriate number of \emph{variables}.

  \item[Positive Existential Formula] (over a signature) The closure
    of $\exists$, $\bigwedge$, and infinitary $\bigvee$ over terms,
    $\bot$, and $\top$.

  \item[Geometric Sequent] $\phi_1 \imp \phi_2$, where $\phi_1$ and
    $\phi_2$ are positive existential formulas.  Written
    $\seq{\phi_1}{\phi_2}$, with $\forall$ suppressed and ',' for
    'and'.

  \item[Geometric Theory] A finite conjunction of geometric
    sequents. Without loss of generality, they can be written in the
    form
    $$ \forall \vec{x}\; (\seq{D(\vec{x})} {\OR_i(\exists \vec{y}_i\;
      .\; E_i(\vec{x}, \vec{y}_i))}) $$ where $D$ and $E_i$ are
    conjunctions of atomic formulas. [There must be better terminology
      than ``strictly geom'' and ``weakly geom''.]

    A relation is \emph{geometric}, or \emph{strictly geometric}, with
    respect to a geometric theory if it can be expressed by adding
    sequents to the theory.  It is \emph{weakly geometric} if it can
    be expressed by expanding the signature as well as adding new
    sequents.

  \item[Inductive Definition] An inductive definition for a relation
    is a positive existential formula, lacking $\forall$, and with
    only finite disjunctions, which may include the relation. It may
    always be written in the form [check]:
    $$ R(\vec{x}) \equiv \OR_i \exists \vec{y}\; \AND_j
    \phi_{ij}(\vec{x}, \vec{y}) $$ where $\phi_ij$ is atomic and may
    contain '=' or $R$.

  \end{description}


\subsection{Some Tricks in GL}

  \begin{description}

  \item[Negating a Sequent] To negate a sequent,
    $$ \seq{\phi(\vec{x})} {\OR_i \exists \vec{y}\; \psi_i(\vec{x},
    \vec{y}, \vec{z})} $$ introduce constants $\vec{x_0}$ and
    $\vec{z_0}$. Force the LHS to be true over $\vec{x_0}$,
    $$ \seq{}{\phi(\vec{x_0})} $$ Then force each disjunct to be false
    over $\vec{x_0}$ and $\vec{z_0}$,
    $$ \seq{\psi_i(\vec{x_0}, \vec{y}, \vec{z_0})}{} $$

  \item[Replacing Functions with Relations and Equations] Create a
    relation symbol $F$ for each function symbol $f$. Add a sequent
    $\seq{F(\vec(x), a), F(\vec(x), b)}{a = b}$. Then replace each
    sequent
    $$ \seq{\phi(f(\vec{x}))} {\OR_i \exists \vec{y}\; \psi(f(\vec{x},
      \vec{y}, \vec{z}))} $$ with
    $$ \seq{F(\vec{x}, a), \phi(a)} {\OR_i \exists \vec{y}\; \exists
      b\; F(\vec{x}, \vec{y}, \vec{z}, b), \psi(b)} $$

  \item[Replacing Constants with Functions and Equality] For each
    constant symbol $c$, create a function symbol $C$, add the sequent
    $\seq{C(x), C(y)}{x = y}$, and replace each occurrence of $c$ with
    $C$.

  \item[Replacing Equality with a Relation] Create a relation
    $E$. Make it symmetric and transitive,
    \begin{align*}
      \aseq{E(x, y)}{E(y, x)} \\ \aseq{E(x, y), E(y, z)}{E(x, z)}
    \end{align*}
    Then add sequents of the form
    $$\seq{R(x), E(x, y)}{R(y)}$$ [Is this all that's neccessary?]

  \item[Replacing Existential Quantifiers with Functions
    (Skolemization)] $\exists x\; R(x, y)$ becomes $R(x, f(x)$

  \end{description}


\subsection{Theorems}

  \begin{theorem}
    Inductive definitions are strictly geometric.
  \end{theorem}

  Expand the inductive definition as an infinite disjunction (first
  the base cases, then the cases with one inductive step,
  etc.). Express this as the right half of a geometric sequent.

  \begin{theorem}
    A geometric theory is satisfiable iff there is a run of the chase
    which does not fail.
  \end{theorem}

  First, see that if a geometric theory is satisfiable then there is a
  run of the chase which does not fail. Let $M$ be one of the models
  satisfying the theory. Begin with an empty chase structure and a map
  from its variables to variables in the model. As long as the chase
  has not terminated, pick an unsatisfied sequent. One of the
  disjuncts of the sequent, interpreted using the variable map, must
  be true in the model. Expand the chase structure to make this
  disjunct true, adding to the variable map as necessary. (But this
  doesn't prove there is a \emph{computable} run of the chase which
  does not fail!)

  Next, if a geometric theory is unsatisfiable then every run of the
  chase fails. Clearly no run of the chase could succeed, because then
  it would produce a model satisfying the theory. Nor could the chase
  run forever, because then the theory would be satisfied by the model
  formed by taking the union of the structures formed by the chase at
  each iteration (more detail?).

  \begin{theorem}
    Let $T$ be geometric.  For any model $M$ of $T$ there is a run of
    the chase that yields a model $N$ of $T$ such that there is a
    homomorphism from $N$ to $M$.
  \end{theorem}

  See above.  The variable map is the homomorphism.

  \begin{theorem}
    [?] Suppose $T$ is geometric and can be expressed with no
    branching on the right hand side of sequents.  If $T$ is
    satisfiable then no run of the chase fails, and any result is a
    universal model.
  \end{theorem}

  As before, pick a model and use it as an oracle for the
  chase. Notice that this time, there are no choices between
  disjuncts; only between sequents. [...?]

\section{Homomorphisms}

  A \emph{graph} is a set of \emph{vertices} along with a set of
  unordered pairs of distinct vertices called \emph{edges}. A
  \emph{digraph} is like a graph, but it's edges are ordered pairs. A
  \emph{relational structure}, or just \emph{structure}, has a set of
  \emph{vertices}, a set of \emph{relations} with natural
  \emph{arity}, and a set of $n$-tuples of vertices for each relation
  of arity $n$.

  Unless otherwise mentioned, the following definitions and theorems
  should apply equally well to all three kinds of objects: graphs,
  digraphs, and structures.

\subsection{Cores}

  \begin{description}
  \item[Homomorphism] A \emph{homomorphism from $G$ to $H$} is a
    function $\phi$ from the vertices of $G$ to the vertices of $H$
    that preserves edges. That is, if $e$ is an edge of $G$, then the
    edge formed by applying $\phi$ to each component of $e$ is an edge
    of $H$.
  \item[Retract] A \emph{retract}, or \emph{folding}, of $G$ is an
    endomorphism $\phi$ onto a subgraph $H$ of $G$ such that $x \in H$
    implies $\phi(x) = x$.
  \item[Core] An object for which every endomorphism is also an
    automorphism.
  \item[Antichain] A set of objects unrelated by homomorphisms.
  \end{description}

\subsection{Results from [1]}
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item A homomorphism equivalence class has at most one core.
  \item A core is uniquely represented as an antichain of connected
    cores.
  \item A graph $G$ is uniquely represented as the infinite sequence
    $|Hom(F_i, G)|$ for any enumeration of all finite graphs $F_i$.
  \end{enumerate}

\subsection{Proofs}
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item If an equivalence class has two cores, then there are
    homomorphisms from each to the other, $\phi$ and $\phi'$. Consider
    the compositions $\phi \compose \phi'$ and $\phi' \compose
    \phi$. The first is an endomorphism from the first object to
    itself, and hence an automorphism, and the second is an
    endomorphism from second object to itself, hence an
    automorphism. Since both $\phi \compose \phi'$ and $\phi' \compose
    \phi$ are bijections, so are $\phi$ and $\phi'$. Now we can show
    that $\phi$ is an isomorphism. We already know that it is a
    bijective homomorphism, so we need only show that it's inverse
    $\phi^{-1}$ is a homomorphism.  $\phi^{-1}$ is equal to $(\phi'
    \compose \phi)^{-1} \compose \phi'$, which is the composition of
    an automorphism and a homomorphism, which is a homomorphism. Thus
    $\phi$ is an isomorphism and the equivalence class's cores are
    isomorphic.
  \item Every core is the disjoint union of some connected
    components. Each component must be a core, or else it would have
    an endomorphism which is not an automorphism and so would the
    whole object. Likewise, there can be no homomorphism between
    components, since it could be used to construct an endomorphism
    which is not an automorphism by mapping one component to the
    other, and every other component to itself. Thus the components of
    any core (which are themselves connected cores) form an antichain.
  \end{enumerate}

  In [2], Bauslaugh points out that cores ought be defined as graphs
  for which every endomorphism is an automorphism, and \emph{not} as a
  vertex-minimal member of a graph homomorphism equivalence class as
  suggested in [1]. For finite graphs, these definitions are
  equivalent, but for infinite graphs only the latter results in cores
  being unique. Consider, for instance, the (countably) infinite graph
  with vertices ${0, 1, 2, ...}$ and edges ${(x, y) | x < y}$. Under
  the vertex-minimal core definition, this graph has an infinite
  number of cores, given by the subgraphs induced by ${n, n+1, n+2,
    ...}$ for any $n \geq 1$. These are in the same homomorphism
  equivalence class -- a forward homomorphism maps $x$ to $x + n$, and
  a reverse homomorphism maps $x$ to $x$. And each core is indeed
  vertex minimal -- they each have infinitely many vertices, and there
  is no homomorphism to any finite graph, since that graph would have
  to include a clique of every order.

  \emph{A jointly universal set of relational structures may have more
    than one core.} Take as an example the set consisting of a
  triangle and a Grotzsch Graph.

  \begin{enumerate}
  \item Determining whether $G$ is $H$-colorable is NP complete for
    fixed $H$ and varying $G$.
  \item If there is a homomorphism from $G$ to $H$, what can you say
    about the existence of cores of $G$ and $H$?
  \item Is the image of every endomorphism isomorphic to a retract?

\section{The Chase}

  A run of the chase \emph{fully terminates} when it returns a finite
  number of finite models and then halts.

\subsubsection{Parallelization}

  It can be unsafe to coerce two rules in parallel. Consider the
  theory
\begin{verbatim}
  -> A & B & S A -> (P & S) | Q B -> P | (Q & S)
\end{verbatim}
  The model ${A, B, S, P, Q}$ could be generated if instances of the
  second and third rules were coerced in parallel, even though it is
  not generated by any run of the chase!

  Likewise, it can be dangerous to coerce two instances of a rule in
  parallel. Consider the theory
\begin{verbatim}
  -> Exists x, y: A(x, y) & A(y, x) A(x, y) -> P(x) | P(y)
\end{verbatim}
  Considering both instances of the second rule in parallel could
  produce the model ${A(0, 1), P(0), P(1)}$, which again is not
  generated by any run of the chase.

  A sufficient condition for it to be safe to consider two rules in
  parallel is when their right hand sides share no relations. In this
  case, coercing the right hand side of

\section{Implementation}

\subsection{Structure}
  The geometric theory is partitioned into three sections:

  \begin{enumerate}
  \item Protocol Specification
  \item Strand Space Axioms
  \item Inference Rules
  \end{enumerate}

\section{Target Theorems}

  \begin{enumerate}
  \item
    Show that every model generated by the chase is, in fact, an
    infiltrated skeleton.
  \item
    If $A$ is a realized infiltrated skeleton, then there exists a
    homomorphism from some model returned by the chase to $A$.
  \item
    Show that the chase fully terminates under certain conditions.
  \end{enumerate}

  [Possible proof technique: assume the theory ends with
    ``completeness rules'' -- the rest of the axioms of the strand
    space formalisms -- and then show them to be unnecessary.]

\section{Strand Spaces}

  The \emph{strand space formalism} was developed as a method for
  formally reasoning about cryptographic protocols. It distinguishes
  between two different kinds of participants: regular participants
  and an adversary. A single physical entity can be represented as
  multiple regular strands if they play more than one role in the
  protocol.

  Participants in a protocol run are represented by \emph{strands},
  and communicate with each other by sending and receiving messages. A
  regular participant is represented by a regular strand and must
  follow the protocol. The adversary is represented by zero or more
  adversary strands, and can manipulate the messages that regular
  strands send and receive.

  The actions of both the regular participants and the advesary are
  abstracted into message passing; this is assumed to be able to
  capture all relevant information. For instance, if a private key is
  assumed insecure and the advesary may be able to learn it, this
  could only be represented by an advesary strand receiving the
  key. As such, every strand consists of a (non-empty) sequence of
  message passing events called \emph{nodes}. Each node either sends a
  message or receives a message. A \emph{term} is any possible
  message.

  In our representation of this formalism, nodes and terms are the
  first-class objects. Strands are represented only indirectly through
  nodes.

\begin{verbatim}
    Forall x. Term(x) | Node(x) Term(x) & Node(x) -> False
\end{verbatim}

\begin{verbatim}
    Send(n, t) -> Node(n) & Term(t) Recv(n, t) -> Node(n) & Term(t)

    Node(n) -> (Exists t. Send(n, t)) | (Exists t. Recv(n, t))

    Send(n, s) & Send(n, t) -> s = t Recv(n, s) & Recv(n, t) -> s = t

    Send(n, s) & Recv(n, t) -> False
\end{verbatim}

\subsection{Messaging}

  Terms are defined inductively over \emph{basic terms} as follows:

  \begin{itemize}
  \item Any basic term is a term.
  \item The ciphertext $\enc{\tau_1}{\tau_2}$ is a term if the
    plaintext $\tau_1$ and the key $\tau_2$ are terms.
  \item The pair $\pair{\tau_1}{\tau_2}$ is a term if $\tau_1$ and
    $\tau_2$ are terms.
  \end{itemize}



\begin{comment}
	\subsection{Strand Spaces}

			A term $t$ is an \emph{ingredient} of another term $u$ if $u$ can
			be constructed from $t$ by repeatedly pairing with arbitrary terms
			and encrypting with arbitrary keys. A \emph{component} of a term
			$t$ is any term that can be retrieved simply by applying repeated
			unpairing operations to $t$ and is not a pair itself.

			A \emph{nonce} is a uniquely-originating basic term. A term $t$
			\emph{originates} on a node $n$ of a strand $s$ if $n$ is a
			sending node, $t$ is an ingredient of the message of $n$, and
			$t$ is not an ingredient of any previous node on $s$. A term is
			\emph{uniquely originating} if it originates on only one
			strand. A term is non-originating if it does not appear in any
			strand.

			If a regular participant generates a random fresh nonce, it
			will be assumed uniquely-originating because of the extreme
			unlikelihood of any other participant generating and
			originating the same value.

			Similarly, non-origination is helpful in describing private
			asymmetric keys that should never be sent as part of a message.

		\subsubsection{The Adversary}

			An adversary is included in the strand space
                        formalism to represent a worst-case situation,
                        where an attacker may control every point of
                        communication between regular participants.
                        The actions of the adversary are represented
                        by \emph{adversary strands}. Recall that
                        adversary strands are not bound by the rules
                        defined by the protocol; they manipulate
                        messages being sent and received by
                        non-adversarial strands.

			The capabilities of the adversary strands are given by the
			Dolev-Yao Threat Model \textbf{references}. The five possible
			operations that an adversary may perform are derived from both
			the Dolev-Yao Threat Model and the strand space formalism.
			These operations are:

			\begin{description}
			\item [pairing] the pairing of two terms
			\item [unpairing] the extraction of a term from a pair
			\item [encryption] given a key $k$ and a plaintext $m$, the construction of the ciphertext $\{|m|\}_k$ by encrypting $m$ with $k$
			\item [decryption] given a ciphertext $\{|m|\}_k$ and its decryption key $k^{-1}$, the extraction of the plaintext $m$
			\item [generation] the generation of an original term when that term is not assumed to be secure
			\end{description}

			Pairing and encryption are \emph{construction operations}.
			Decryption and unpairing are \emph{deconstruction operations}.

		\subsection{Paths}

			An \emph{edge} is a directional relationship between two nodes.
			The direct predecessor of a node within its strand is called its
			\emph{parent}. Not every node has a parent. Whenever a node $n$ has
			a parent $p$, there is an edge from $p$ to $n$. A \emph{link} is an
			edge from a sending node to a receiving node that have the same
			message. If there is a node $n$ with a link to a node $m$, $n$
			sends $m$ a message and $m$ receives it unaltered. The \emph{path}
			relation, written $x < y$, is the transitive closure of the edge
			relation. A node $n$ \emph{precedes} another node $m$ when there is
			a path from $n$ to $m$. In this formalism, events are partially
			ordered.

		\subsubsection{Normalisation / Simplification}

			Two simplifying assumptions can be made about the sequence of
			actions an adversary can perform without limiting their
			capabilities. These simplifications are called normalisation and
			efficiency. Guttman and Thayer \cite{GJF02} proved that adding
			these constraints does not limit the capabilities of an adversary.

			A protocol is \emph{efficient} if an adversary always takes a
			message from the earliest point at which it appears. To be precise,
			a protocol is efficient if, for every sending node $m$ and receiving
			adversary node $n$, if every component of $m$ is also a component of
			$n$, then there is no regular node $m'$ such that $m < m' < n$.

			A protocol is \emph{normal} if, for any path through adversary
			strands, the adversary always either performs a generation followed
			by zero or more construction operations or performs zero or more
			deconstruction operations followed by zero or more construction
			operations. This constraint limits redundancy.

			An important insight used in Cremers' algorithm \cite{Cremers08},
			which will be called \emph{chaining}, states that terms in messages
			received from an adversary strand always originate in a
			non-adversarial strand. In simpler terms, an adversary can not send
			a message to himself nor receive a message from himself.

	\subsection{The Problem}

		Some protocol researchers want to be able to programmatically reason
		about cryptographic protocols. A common technique for this is to find a
		set of essentially different classes of protocol runs, which are each a
		subset of all possible runs of the protocol. Together, these classes
		encompass every possible run of the protocol. This can be accomplished
		by finding minimal models of a geometric logic representation of the
		protocol. This happens to be precisely the problem the chase solves.

		\textbf{ things from Justin go here later }

	\subsection{The Solution: Minimal Models}

		Given a theory $T$, the jointly minimal models $\mathcal{M}$ that the
		chase outputs are representative of all models because there always
		exists a homomorphism from some model $\mathbb{M} \in \mathcal{M}$ to
		any model that satisfies $T$. Every model $\mathbb{N}$ that satisfies
		$T$ describes a possible run of the protocol. It also indirectly
		represents a larger class of runs, specifically the set of all runs of
		the protocol that are described by a model $\mathbb{P}$ such that
		$\mathbb{P} \models T$ and $\mathbb{N} \preceq \mathbb{P}$.

		Since the set of all models output of the chase is jointly minimal,
		they represents every possible run of the protocol. Finding every
		possible run of the protocol would be prohibitive because there are
		infinitely many. Fortunately, the chase may halt with a finite result,
		providing a model that is representative of a class of protocol runs.
		Fortunately, the deterministic chase implementation may output a finite
		number of models before halting. These models are jointly minimal, and
		therefore represent all runs of the protocol.

	\subsection{Designing An Analogous Theory}

		In order to create a geometric theory describing a protocol, the
		formul{\ae} that define strand spaces, normilisation, efficiency, and
		chaining must be derived. The formul{\ae} defining the protocol must be
		combined with this scaffolding to create a theory that can be used to
		infer the possible runs of the protocol.

		The \emph{half-duplex protocol} was chosen to be used as an example.
		This protocol involves two participants, Alice and Bob, and specifies
		that the following actions take place:

		\begin{enumerate}
		\item Alice sends Bob a nonce that she generated, encrypted with Bob's public key
		\item Bob receives the encrypted nonce
		\item Bob replies to Alice with the decrypted nonce

		A visual representation of the protocol, as modeled in the strand space
		formalism, can be seen in Figure \ref{fig:half-duplex}, Appendix
		\ref{sec:appendixHalfDuplex}.

		The geometric logic rules that model this protocol were generated
		manually by direct translation into geometric logic. Ideally, the
		process of generating geometric logic formul{\ae} from protocols should
		be done automatically.

        %% The chase can be used for protocol analysis. A common technique for the analysis
	%% of protocols involves identifying the \emph{essentially different} runs of
	%% the protocol. These essentially different protocol runs are analogous to
	%% minimal models. When a protocol is described using geometric logic, the
	%% chase can find such minimal models. The protocol can then be analysed for
	%% characteristics such as the existence of security violations or other
	%% unexpected behaviour.
