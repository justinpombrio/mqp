Principle 1.1 (The Nonce Test)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Suppose that uniq(c) and c is found in some message received in a skeleton A at a node n1. Moreover, suppose that, in the message of n1, c is found outside all of a number of encrypted forms [t1]k1, ... [tj]Kj. Then in any enrichment B of A such that B is a possible execution, either:

1. One of the matching decryption keys Ki' is disclosed before n1 occurs, so that c could be extracted by the advesary; or else

2. Some regular strand contains a node m1 in which c is transmitted outside [t1]K1, ... [tj]Kj, but in all previous nodes m0 =>+ m1, c was found (if at all) only within these encryptions. Moreover, m1 occurs before n1.

Principle 1.3 (The Encryption Test)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Suppose that [t]K is found in some message received in a skeleton A at a node n1. Then in any enrichment B of A such that B is a possible execution, either:

1. The encryption key K is disclosed before n1 occurs, so that the advesary could construct [t]K from t; or else

2. A regular strand contains a node m1 in which [t]K is transmitted, but not earlier node m0 =>+ m1 contains [t]K. Moreover, m1 occurs before n1.

Theorem 5.5 (Authentication Test Principle)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. If every cut in A is solved, then A is realized.
2. If A is realized, then A has an extension A', obtained by adding only listener nodes, in which every cut is solved.

Definition 5.2 (Cut, Solved)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Simple(c), s: {Encr}
Cut(c, s) = {n : Exists m: Node(n), Node(m), Precedes(m, n), Unprotected(c, s, msg(m))

Solved(n, c, s) =
  Exists m: m in Cut(c, s)
| 

___________________________________________________________________________________

Basic(c) | (Exists g, k: Encr(g, k, c)) -> Simple(c);

Algorithm
~~~~~~~~~

1. Find an unrealized reception node n.

2. Consider each simple ingredient c of n.
Recv(n, t) & Ingredient(c, t) & Simple(c) -> Test(c, n);

3. Collect the topmost encryptions in which c appears from n's predecessors.

4. If c appears outside those encryptions in n, then the cut is unsolved.

5. A cut can be solved by ___ or by ___.
